//WELCOME TO THE CHARACTER CREATOR
// Please follow the instructions for each question and answer to the best of your abilities.
// The solutions are included in the zip but do not reference them until you and your partner(s)
// have researched and tried everything you can think of.
// Modify your answers as you go through to make the following console.log statements work :

//Each console.log statement number corresponds to the question that should make it work.
//*********************************************

// 1) console.log(BadGuy);
// 3) console.log(badDude.name);
// 4) console.log(scaryGuy.name);
// 6) console.log(badDude.sayTagLine());

//*********************************************

// 1) Create a constructor function called BadGuy.

// 2) Give the BadGuy constructor the ability to take a parameter of "name".
// Inside the constructor function, assign the parameter "name" to the property of name so when you
// create a new instance of BadGuy, you can assign the bad guy a name.

// 3) Create a new instance of BadGuy called badDude. Give badDude the name of "Hans Gruber"

// 4) Create a new instance of BadGuy called scaryGuy. Give scaryGuy the name of "Freddy"

// 5) Give the BadGuy constructor a tagLine method that will take the parameter "tagline" and say the tag line when prompted by a new instance in the following format: console.log("this.name" + " said " + this.tagline); ...

// 6) Make Hans Gruber (the badDude instance say "That's a beautiful suit....I'd hate to ruin it.")
